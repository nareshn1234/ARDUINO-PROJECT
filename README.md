# ARDUINO-PROJECT
* This project explores an intelligent and automated approach to waste management, leveraging modern technologies to enhance efficiency, sustainability, and environmental responsibility. Traditional waste management systems often rely on manual segregation, inefficient collection schedules, and inadequate real-time monitoring, leading to increased pollution and operational inefficiencies.

* Our Smart Waste Management System integrates automated segregation and real-time monitoring to optimize waste processing. It employs sensor-based classification, IoT-enabled monitoring, and AI-driven decision-making to streamline waste collection, reduce human intervention, and ensure proper disposal of recyclable and non-recyclable materials.

# **Algorithms Explored**

1. Waste Classification Algorithm – Uses IR sensors to classify biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste.

2. IoT-Based Monitoring Algorithm – Tracks bin fill levels using load sensors and sends real-time alerts via cloud integration.

3. Motor Control Algorithm – Operates servo motors for automated waste sorting based on sensor data.

4. Data Transmission Algorithm – Uses MQTT/HTTP for real-time data transfer to a cloud dashboard.

5. AI-Driven Waste Prediction – Applies machine learning to predict waste accumulation trends and optimize collection schedules.

# **Dataset for Smart Waste Management**

1. Waste Classification Dataset – Images of waste (plastic, paper, metal, glass, organic) for AI-based identification.

2. Sensor-Based Dataset – Sensor readings (IR, ultrasonic, load) mapped to waste types for automated segregation.

3. IoT Bin Monitoring Dataset – Bin fill levels, timestamps, and location data for real-time tracking.

4. Waste Prediction Dataset – Historical waste levels and environmental factors for ML-based forecasting.

# **Hardware Used**

1. Arduino Uno – Microcontroller for processing sensor data.
2. IR Sensors – Detects different waste types.
3. Servo Motors – Controls waste segregation mechanism.
4. Load Sensors – Monitors bin fill levels.
