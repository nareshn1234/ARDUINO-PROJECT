# **BLOCK DIAGRAM COMPONENTS :**

1. **Arduino Board:** The Arduino is the brain of the system, a programmable microcontroller that coordinates all operations. 
It receives input from various sensors, processes this data according to programmed logic, and controls output devices. 
The Arduino can be programmed using C++ to define how it interprets sensor data and when to trigger alerts. 
It's versatile, cost-effective, and has a large community of developers, making it ideal for IoT projects like this smart garbage alert system.

2. **LCD Display:** The Liquid Crystal Display provides visual output for the system. 
It can show real-time information such as the current fill level of the bin, temperature readings, or system status messages.
The LCD is typically controlled by the Arduino, which sends commands to update the display. 
This component is crucial for providing easily readable information to waste management personnel or anyone checking the bin status on-site.

3. **Ultrasonic Sensors:** Ultrasonic sensors use sound waves to measure distance. 
They emit high-frequency sound pulses and measure the time it takes for the echo to return.
In this system, they're used to detect the fill level of the garbage bin by measuring the distance from the sensor (mounted at the top of the bin) to the surface of the garbage.
Multiple sensors might be used for more accurate readings or to monitor different sections of the bin.

4. **LEDs:** Light Emitting Diodes serve as simple, effective visual indicators in the system. 
They can be programmed to show different alert levels - for example, green for empty, yellow for partially full, and red for full. 
LEDs are energy-efficient and can be easily seen from a distance, making them ideal for quick status checks.
The Arduino controls when and which LEDs light up based on the data from the sensors.

5. **Buzzer:** The buzzer produces audio alerts, adding another dimension to the notification system.
It can be programmed to sound when the bin reaches a certain fill level or if there's an issue with the system that requires immediate attention. 
The Arduino controls the buzzer, determining when it should activate and for how long.
This audio alert is particularly useful for grabbing attention in noisy environments or when visual alerts might be missed.

6. **IR Sensor:** An Infrared (IR) sensor is an electronic device that detects IR radiation in its surrounding environment.
It consists of an IR LED (emitter) and an IR photodiode (receiver) working together. 
The sensor emits IR radiation and detects the reflection from nearby objects.
IR sensors are widely used in various applications, from obstacle detection in robotics to proximity sensing in smartphones, due to their simplicity, low cost, and effectiveness in short-range detection.

7. **Breadboard:** The breadboard is a construction base for prototyping electronics. 
It allows for easy connection of various components to the Arduino without soldering.
This is particularly useful during the development and testing phase of the project.
The breadboard has a grid of holes into which component leads and jumper wires can be inserted to create circuits.
It facilitates quick modifications and experimentation with different circuit configurations.

8. **Power Supply:** While not explicitly shown in the image, a power supply is essential for the system.
It provides the necessary electrical power to run all components. 
This could be a battery pack for portability, a solar panel for sustainable operation, or a mains-connected power adapter. 
The power supply needs to provide stable, appropriate voltage levels for the Arduino and other components to function reliably.
